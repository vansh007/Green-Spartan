# The Green Spartan

## Analysis of Global Land Surface Temperature Change

TheGreenSpartan application is designed to spread awareness among people especially students in SJSU about climate change and its impact on our planet. This project aims to provide a first-hand, interactive experience with data to show that climate change is real. We use machine learning to predict the global surface temperature in each country in the coming years.

# Set Up

## Install Requirements

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the app
To run the application, use the `flask` command or `python -m flask`.

Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

> set FLASK_APP=main
> flask run

where main is the name of the pythoon file (i.e. `main.py`)
